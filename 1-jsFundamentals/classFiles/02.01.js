/*
Challenge 1:
Write a for loop that loops 10 times.  Every time the loop is run, it calls a function.
The function should console.log a random number between 0 and 1.  Once you've completed
the challenge with a for-loop, see if you can make this work with a for-of loop.  If 
you can solve that problem, see if you can solve this with a for-each loop.  Note that 
for-of and for-each loops require slightly different conditions to work than a for 
loop requires.

Challenge 2:
Let's compose functions!  Your first function should take a function as input and return that function
with a function call.  Your second function should take a string as input and return that string with 
extra stuff added to that string.  Console.log the results of your function calls.  Additional information
is below to help clarify what you're doing (the below is just an example):

first function: input-secondFunc output-secondFunc('coding is great!')
second function: input-'coding is great!' output-'coding is great!  pie is, too!'
*/
function firstFunc(funcParam){
  return funcParam('coding is great!');
}
function secondFunc(str){
  return str + ' pie is too!';
}

console.log(firstFunc(secondFunc));

//Challenge 3: 
//make 2 functions.  the first function takes a function as input, and calls that input function
//with a number value.  the second function takes a number as input, and concatenates that
//number with a string.  the second function should return the concatenation.  the first
//function should return the call. 
function func1(input){ //'input' refers to 'func2' from line 100
  return input(7);//'input(7)' is the same as 'return num + ':i am a number''
}
function func2(num){ //'func2' only runs because of 'func1'
  return num + ':i am a number';
}

console.log(func1(func2));
